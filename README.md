This gem allows you to gather U.K. Ordnance Survey Eastings, North, and Map
References from a range of text inputs.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'os_map_ref'
```

And then update your dependencies by calling

```bash
$ bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as

```bash
$ gem install os_map_ref
```

## Usage

To convert a map reference to eastings and northings

```ruby
location = OsMapRef::Location.for 'ST5880171043'

location.easting       == 358801
location.northing      == 171043
location.map_reference == 'ST 58801 71043'
```

To convert eastings and northings to a map reference

```ruby
location = OsMapRef::Location.for '358801, 171043'

location.easting       == 358801
location.northing      == 171043
location.map_reference == 'ST 58801 71043'
```

### From OS Map Reference to Longitude and Latitude

If your end result needs to be longitude and latitude, you can combine the
OsMapRef output with that of another gem called
[global_convert](https://github.com/reggieb/global_convert)

For example

```ruby
require 'global_convert'
require 'os_map_ref'

os_location = OsMapRef::Location.for 'ST 58801 71043'

location = GlobalConvert::Location.new(
  input: {
    projection: :osgb36,
    lon: os_location.easting,
    lat: os_location.northing
  },
  output: {
    projection: :wgs84
  }
)

puts "Latitude = #{location.lat} in radians."
puts "Longitude = #{location.lon} in radians."
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bundle exec rake` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
