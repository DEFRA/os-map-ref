# Have this option to stop travis-ci building twice. Currently we have travis set to build both
# PR's and pushes. However this means when we push to a PR we have to wait for Travis to finish
# 2 builds. If we unticked 'pushes' when the PR was finally merged that would not be built. The
# brute force approach would be to untick build PR's and just build all pushes. We instead have
# gone with the approach outlined here http://stackoverflow.com/a/31882307
